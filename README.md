Hello!

There are some python dependencies which will function in virtualenv, I hope that doesn't break the "out of the box" requirement. 
Required: 
\$ pip install flask flask-jsonpify flask-sqlalchemy flask-restful

Known Issues:
 * Lacks a full suite of internal error handling and associated output
 * IRL it would probably would have input validation
